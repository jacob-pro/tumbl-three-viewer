# TumblThree Archive Viewer

Warning this is very experimental; it may not work in a lot of cases.

It only works when the metadata has been downloaded in the older text format, and only works
when the media URLs match the downloaded filename (older posts only!)

See: https://github.com/TumblThreeApp/TumblThree/issues/229

## Usage

From your `Blogs` directory run the serve script.

Open <http://localhost:7007> in your browser.
